- Press `Space`: jump
- Press `C`: toggles chess mode
- Press `R`: triggers resync
- Hold `[KEY BELOW]` + Press `Up/Down Arrow`
    - `T`: increase/decrease tempo (global bpm)
    - `B`: increase/decrease bpm of current platform
    - `N`: increase/decrease number of pads on current platform
    - `G`: change gravity setting (earth, moon, zero-g, jupiter)
    - `L`: increase/decrease launch force 


## What to show in demo
1. sequence
2. change number of pads
3. change bpm + resync
4. change gravity
5. change launch force
6. change tempo + resync    (beat lines up!!)
7. go back to earth gravity, and dive to first platform
8. toggle chess mode
9. change to zero-g, launch, drift over earth as everything reaches clipping distance

## What to finish tmrw
- record background music
- add display menu showing current settings (top right corner, white text)
- e.g
    - (T) global tempo: 120
    - (B) local bpm: 110            (set to ??? when in the air)
    - (N) number of pads: 12        (set to ??? when in the air)
    - (G) gravity: EARTH
    - (L) launch force: 2000 N
    - (C) chess mode: ON
